          My name is Tahoor Ahmed, and I am a highly skilled MERN (MongoDB,
          Express.js, React.js, Node.js) developer with 2 years of professional
          experience. I am dedicated to creating efficient and user-friendly web
          applications using the MERN stack. I have a strong passion for web
          development and strive to contribute to innovative projects that have
          a positive impact. During my career, I have gained expertise in both
          front-end and back-end technologies, allowing me to work on various
          aspects of web development. I have hands-on experience with MongoDB
          for database management, Express.js for building robust web APIs,
          React.js for creating interactive user interfaces, and Node.js for
          server-side development.
        </p>
        <p>
          My ultimate goal is to utilize my skills and knowledge to contribute
          to meaningful projects that push the boundaries of innovation. I am
          excited to be a part of teams that share the same passion for creating
          impactful solutions and strive to make a positive difference in the
          world.
